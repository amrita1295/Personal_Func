              Haven’t we all heard about the benefits and the importance of
              physical fitness in our lives? In present times, there has been an
              increase in the number of people who are becoming conscious and
              cautious about their bodies. Now more than ever, a rising number
              of the urban population lead a sedentary lifestyle which has
              indeed created a greater need to find creative ways to keep the
              body moving, thus inculcating a healthier and fitter body
              structure.

              However, this rapid rise in conversations around having a fit body
              does not address or help in understanding the actual definitions
              of fitness. Social media posts and advertisements depict
              celebrities and their body structures as the “ideal body type” and
              as “fitness goals” without discussing what fitness is and how
              subjective fitness standards can be. In this article, we will be
              addressing this gap in conversations and attempt to assist you in
              recognizing the very pertinent concepts of fitness and a healthy
              body.

              Every time someone utters the word fitness we generally end up
              imagining a skinny person who barely eats anything in the name of
              achieving their fitness goals or imagine a person who spends hours
              doing workouts in the gym.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-justify">
              However, fitness is far away from any of these scenarios.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-justify">
              Fitness can be a broad term that means different things to
              different people. The standards of fitness are very subjective to
              each person, but in general, the word refers to your optimal
              health and overall well-being. It incorporates the over-all
              wellbeing of the body and allows one to perform daily activities,
              sports and movements without any hassle.

            <p className="mt-3 text-justify">
              Contrary to popular opinion, being fit is not just about our
              physical health, but emotional and mental health, too. Nutritious
              eating, regular resting and active living are fundamental ways to
              achieve a fit body.

              As has been discussed earlier, the internet and social media
              portray fitness in a certain way which can often be flawed. In the

             <span className="font-semibold text-[#000000]"> LONG WORKOUTS ARE REQUIRED FOR RESULTS:</span> There is a general belief
              that to get results and to have a fit body, one needs to spend
              hours working out at the gym. This myth originates from the
              assumption that quantity is better than quality. However, it is a
              flawed one. Short workouts can be effective too. In other words,
              if you can squeeze 30 minutes of workout time, do not let that
              discourage you. It is important to recognize the quality and the
              effort you put during your workout regimes.

              <span className="font-semibold text-[#000000]">TRAINING EVERYDAY GIVES BETTER OUTCOMES:</span> A lot of us wrongly
              believe that working out relentlessly every single day is a good
              way to yield results. However, the truth remains that rest days
              are important to recover and recuperate. Experts believe that
              working out every single day does more harm than good. Emily
              Hutchins, a Performance Enhancement Specialist says in an
              interview “If you never change the oil in your car, it will burn
              out the engine. It is the same with the human body. If you don’t
              take time to repair and rest, your body will fail you.”

              <span className="font-semibold text-[#000000]">ALL FIT BODIES LOOK THE SAME:</span> Fuled by the internet and social
              media, fitness is generally promoted from a one size fits all
              perspective. However, the reality is quite different. A skinny and
              sculpted body does not always result in a fit body. Fitness is a
              way of life that generates overall wellbeing of body and mind, and
              not just looking a certain way. As a society, we do not consider
              larger bodies to be attractive. But the pursuit of a healthy body
              cannot be and should not be equated to a thin body.

              <span className="font-semibold text-[#000000]">UNDER-EATING HELPS IN LOSING WEIGHT:</span> A lot of people remain under
              the impression that starving their body by not eating enough will
              help them lose weight and will also result in a fitter body. This
              isn’t a helpful exercise. Undereating regularly leads to a slower
              metabolism. With too few calories in your system day after day,
              your body learns to live with less and it does this by slowing
              down your metabolism. Further, not taking enough calories leads to
              a reduction of energy levels, hair loss, sleep issues and various
              other health problems.

              It’s overwhelming to be a part of the fitness industry, due to the
              growing number of information around it. But it is important to
              know and realise that there is no one way to achieve a fit body.
              Everyone has subjective standards of fitness, which helps them
              utilise their body in the most optimum nature.
